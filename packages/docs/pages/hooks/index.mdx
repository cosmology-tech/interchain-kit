There are multiple hooks provided in CosmosKit. They all require [**ChainProvider**](/provider/chain-provider) from either `@cosmos-kit/react` or `@cosmos-kit/react-lite` to provide necessary information.

- [`useChain`](/hooks/use-chain): Provide chainWallet related properties and methods, and support multiple chains connected at one time. When `useChain` is called, corresponding chainWallets will be activated.

- [`useChainWallet`](/hooks/use-chain-wallet): Provide chainWallet related properties and methods, and support multiple chains and wallets connected at one time. When `useChainWallet` is called, corresponding chainWallet will be activated.

- [`useManager`](/hooks/use-manager): Manage all chains and wallets.

- [`useModalTheme`](/hooks/use-modal-theme): Manage default modal themes.

- [`useNameService`](/hooks/use-name-service): Get alias name of address from a particular name server.

- [`useWallet`](/hooks/use-wallet): Manage all chainWallets and the global status for a particular wallet.

- [`useWalletClient`](/hooks/use-manager): Get the wallet client for a particular wallet.

- [`useIframe`](/hooks/use-iframe): Set up an iframe that can access the currently connected wallet automatically.

## Differences Between `useChain` And `useChainWallet`

1. `useChainWallet` requires an extra parameter `walletName`.
2. `useChain` will pop up a wallet modal to connect while `useChainWallet` not.
3. `useChain` exposes extra `openView` and `closeView` methods and `walletRepo` property.
4. the return value of methods `getRpcEndpoint`, `getRestEndpoint`, `getStargateClient`, `getCosmWasmClient`, `getNameService` can be different between `useChain` and `useChainWallet`, because `useChain` explores all `chainWallets` related to the parameter `chainName`.
