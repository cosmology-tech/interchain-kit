# How to Add Trust Wallet to CosmosKit

There are three packages for Trust

- `@cosmos-kit/trust`
- `@cosmos-kit/trust-extension` (NOT recommended)
- `@cosmos-kit/trust-mobile`

> ðŸ’¡ According to [Trust Doc](https://developer.trustwallet.com/developer/develop-for-trust/browser-extension), Trust Wallet Browser Extension currently supports only Ethereum & EVM chains, and support for Cosmos is still in progress. Because of the block from wallet side, `@cosmos-kit/trust-extension` is not fully implemented yet and we don't recommend to use it for now.
>
> Because of the reason above, only `@cosmos-kit/trust-mobile` is included in `@cosmos-kit/trust` so far.

Take `@cosmos-kit/trust` for example

## install `@cosmos-kit/trust`

```
yarn add @cosmos-kit/trust
```

## import the wallets

```js
import { wallets as trust } from "@cosmos-kit/trust";
```

## add to your provider

```js
function MyCosmosApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
      <ChainProvider
        chains={chains}
        assetLists={assets}
        wallets={[...trust]}
        walletConnectOptions={...} // required if `wallets` contains mobile wallets
      >
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </ChainProvider>
  );
}

export default MyCosmosApp;
```
